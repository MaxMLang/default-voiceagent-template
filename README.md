## Features

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with server-side rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- **Vapi Integration** - Seamless AI voice agent capabilities
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Easy Customization** - Modular components and clear structure
- **Docker Support** - Containerized deployment for any environment
- **Environment Variables** - Secure configuration management

## Prerequisites

The following files are required for the voice agent to work:
- `hooks/use-vapi.ts` - Custom hook for Vapi integration
- `components/orb.tsx` - The voice interface component
- `.env` - Environment configuration file (copy from `.env.example`)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials from the [Vapi Dashboard](https://vapi.ai/dashboard)

## Environment Configuration

The `.env.example` file includes:

```
# Vapi API credentials
# Get these from https://vapi.ai/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_API_KEY=your_public_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id_here

# Optional: Additional configuration
# NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_SERVER_URL=https://api.vapi.ai
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

These environment variables are essential for connecting to the Vapi platform.

## Getting Started

After setting up your environment variables, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Docker Setup

This template includes Docker support for easy deployment in any environment:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ai-voice-agent .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env ai-voice-agent
   ```

   Alternatively, specify environment variables directly:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -e NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_API_KEY=your_key -e NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_id ai-voice-agent
   ```

3. Access your application at http://localhost:3000

You can also use Docker Compose for a more streamlined setup:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Deployment Options

This template can be deployed virtually anywhere:

- **Vercel**: One-click deployment with the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new)
- **Docker**: Deploy to any environment that supports Docker containers
- **Kubernetes**: Scale your application with Kubernetes orchestration
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Deploy to major cloud providers
- **Self-hosted**: Run on your own infrastructure

For production deployments, consider using environment variables through your hosting platform rather than .env files.

## Customization

This template is designed to be highly customizable:

### Voice Agent Behavior
- Modify the assistant settings in the Vapi Dashboard
- Customize conversation flows and responses
- Add domain-specific knowledge to your agent

### UI/UX
- Edit `app/page.tsx` to change the main page layout
- Modify `components/orb.tsx` to customize the voice interface
- Use Tailwind classes to style components to match your brand

### Backend Integration
- Connect to your own APIs or databases
- Add authentication for personalized experiences
- Implement webhooks for advanced functionality

- Use environment variables for all sensitive information

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify your Vapi API key and Assistant ID are correct
2. Check that your environment variables are properly loaded
